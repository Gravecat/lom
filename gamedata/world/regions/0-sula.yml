REGION_IDENTIFIER:
  name: The Floating Island of Sula
  version: 1

SULA_PLAINS:
  desc: >
    A wide field of grassy plains surrounds you, occasional bright flowers punctuating the green with a flash of colour. The sun shines brightly overhead, the
    sky a clear blue with a few wisps of clouds. To the east stands a small wooden shack - more of a shed, really.
  exits:
    east: SULA_SHACK
  name: [ Grassy Plains, plains ]

SULA_SHACK:
  desc: >
    The interior of this small wooden shack reveals it to be more of a shed than anything, various shelves attached to the walls holding miscellaneous
    bric-a-brac, while a few dusty barrels and crates occupy the east wide. The only door leads back outside, to the west.
  exits:
    west: SULA_PLAINS
  name: [ Wooden Shack, shack ]
